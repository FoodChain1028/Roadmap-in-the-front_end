# Roadmap-in-the-front_end
> I was inspired by [this article](https://betterprogramming.pub/frontend-development-the-essentials-1c1290b43590) writen by Alireza Bonab, which introduce the roadmap to the front-end development.

## About Me
- a senior studying in National Taiwan University
- majoring in Plant Pathology & Microbiology
- mesmerized with blockchain tech
- targeting to be a DApp developer and also smart-contract developer 

## Preface
It's really hard to become a DApp developer without the skills in web development. However, although I have taken several basic courses, including programming design, python, data structures and algorithm, etc, I am a total beginner in web development "yet". I'd searched for several resources on Google, yet there were plenty of them and were not systemic nor connectable among them.
